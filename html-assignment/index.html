        <h2>About me</h2>

        <p>My name is <em>Fallon Silvana Pulido Masmela</em>, I am from Colombia, I am 29 years old, I was born on November 28<sup>th</sup> 1993. In Colombia I studied a 2-year Human Resources technology at <abbr title="National Learning Service">SENA</abbr> for its acronym in Spanish. And all my work experience in Colombia is in the administrative area.</p>

        <p>In 2017 I decided to move to Australia where I lived for about 5 years. I got married there on March 21<sup>st</sup> 2018, and had my baby. He was born on September 29<sup>th</sup> 2021. I had the opportunity to form my family, have the experience of living in another country and learn the language. But with the baby it is difficult to live far from our country. So, with my husband decided to move to Canada since it is a great country, and it is closer to my country of origin.</p>
